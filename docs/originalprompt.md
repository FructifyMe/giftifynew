### Introduction

Giftify is a gift management app designed to streamline gift-giving for all occasions. It allows users to create personal wishlists, form collaborative gifting groups, and track gift acquisitions, all with the aid of real-time data management and price tracking features. The primary goal of this user journey is to enable a stress-free gifting experience, ensuring that every gift is unique and every occasion is celebrated seamlessly. This document outlines the entire user journey through Giftify, emphasizing the app's core functionalities and user actions from onboarding to everyday use.

### Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

New users discover Giftify through its modern landing page, which features a captivating design and a prominent “Start Now” call-to-action. This button directs users to the sign-up page, where they can register using their email and a secure password, powered by Supabase's authentication service. During registration, users are required to input their first and last names, which are used for their user profiles. After account creation, first-time users are guided through a brief onboarding process showcasing key app features such as wishlist creation, group management, and gift claims. Existing users can sign in using their registered email and password, and the app offers a password recovery option for users who have forgotten their credentials.

### Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon logging in, users are taken to the Home Screen, which acts as the central hub for the application. This dashboard is designed with user accessibility in mind, providing quick links to wishlists, groups, and notification sections. The layout includes a sidebar for easy navigation to other key areas of the application, such as settings and user profiles. From this home page, users can easily move to any specific feature like managing wishlists or exploring gifting groups by selecting the respective section in the navigation menu.

### Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The Wishlist Screen is the dedicated interface where users can create and manage their wishlists. Users add items to their list by specifying item details like name, retailer link, image, and pricing. To facilitate organization, a tagging system allows users to categorize items based on different occasions or intended recipients. Users interested in collaborative gifting can navigate to the Group Management Page, where they can create new groups or join existing ones via invitation links. Upon joining, users can view shared wishlists and claim gifts to avoid duplication; claimed gifts become invisible to other members, preserving the surprise. To complement these features, Giftify employs price-tracking APIs to monitor wishlist items, notifying users about price changes through alerts managed within the app's notification system. Users also have the option to export any wishlist or claimed gift data into CSV format for offline use.

### Settings and Account Management

Giftify's settings and account management features are easily accessible from the Home Screen. Users can update personal information, manage notification preferences, and adjust account settings including alert mechanisms for price changes. Future plans include integrating a subscription model through Stripe, though financial features are not active in the initial rollout. After modifying account settings, users easily navigate back to the Home Screen via a consistent navigation structure across all pages.

### Error States and Alternate Paths

If users encounter errors, such as entering invalid data or losing connectivity, Giftify presents clear error messages and, where necessary, fallback pages to guide the user back to normal functionality. For example, failed sign-in attempts due to incorrect passwords will display helpful hints to recover access, such as directing users to the password recovery process. In any online transaction area or during group gift claims, temporary technical issues might result in queued actions that resolve when connectivity is restored, reassuring users with on-screen feedback.

### Conclusion and Overall App Journey

Giftify offers a comprehensive gift management solution for seamless user experiences from sign-up to daily use. Beginning with a visually appealing onboarding process, users quickly adapt to the platform's functionalities, such as wishlist creation, group agreements, and price monitoring. Regular users enjoy a fluid journey centered around enhancing celebration festivities through organized gifting, culminating in stress-free occasions made better by smart, real-time gift management.

### Introduction

Giftify is a sleek gift management application developed to streamline the gifting process for all occasions.

Furthermore, responsive design ensures that the application is usable across a variety of devices and screen sizes, which is key to user satisfaction in today’s mobile-first world.

### Styling and Theming

In Giftify, styling and theming are handled with a combination of Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI, which ensures a consistent and appealing aesthetic throughout the application. Tailwind CSS is employed for its utility-first approach, enabling the creation of stylish, customizable, and responsive layouts. Theming is an integral part of the styling process, ensuring brand coherence through the use of earth-tone colors inspired by leaves, conveying warmth and harmony which align with Giftify’s brand identity focused on comforting aesthetics.

### Component Structure

The application adheres to a component-based structure where frontend components are organized to ensure reusability and maintainability. Components are modular, meaning they can be developed, tested, and updated independently without affecting the overall application. This approach not only enhances code maintainability but also supports rapid development processes by enabling the easy integration of new features or adjustments as needed.

### State Management

State management in Giftify is handled using the state management practices and libraries supported by Vite + React. This ensures that the state is efficiently managed and distributed across components, providing a seamless user experience. The state management system is designed to handle changes promptly and reflect these across all relevant components in real-time, a crucial feature when dealing with functions like price tracking and gift claiming.

### Routing and Navigation

Routing within Giftify is managed through Vite + React's built-in capabilities, which facilitate intuitive navigation and fast transitions between various application sections. This enhances user experience by minimizing load times and providing a smooth journey through different app functionalities such as wishlist management, group setups, and gift claiming.

### Performance Optimization

Performance in Giftify is optimized using strategies such as lazy loading, which defers the loading of non-essential components until they are needed. Code splitting and asset optimization ensure that only necessary parts of the code are loaded at a given time, thereby reducing load times. Together, these strategies enhance user satisfaction by maintaining the application’s speed and responsiveness even as its user base expands.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

Quality assurance for Giftify includes a comprehensive testing strategy involving unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, ensuring all elements function as intended. Tools such as Jest and Cypress are employed to automate these tests, which help maintain code reliability and application stability. Through these rigorous quality checks, the application remains robust against potential bugs or inefficiencies, ensuring a high caliber of user experience.
